CloudPanel v1 is **obsolete**; check out the [CloudPanel v2 Docs](https://www.cloudpanel.io/docs/v2/introduction/).

**CloudPanel** doesn't provide **E-Mail** because of **performance**. We want to keep it **clean** and **lightweight**.

**E-Mail** is very **complex** and shouldn't be handled by the server that runs your **PHP Apps**.

There are many companies that offer professional **E-Mail** services for less than **$ 1 / user** per **month**.

In the next section, you will find some **services** that can be used for handling your **E-Mails**.

## E-Mail Service Providers

- [Zoho Mail](https://www.zoho.com/mail/) (**FREE** but limited, **POP3** and **IMAP** only in paid version)
- [Google G Suite](https://gsuite.google.com/) (Our **recommendation**)
- [Amazon WorkMail](https://aws.amazon.com/workmail/)
